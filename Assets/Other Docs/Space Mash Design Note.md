Space Mash Storyboard

1. Start game out with one unique and easy flying robot and it shoots one bullet
2. As you kill more enemys, you meet new enemies and they are harder (ability type) but unique (Robot, Asteriod, Boss Type Robot with stages)
2a. Robots are floating units that shoot one bullet and move on a randomly determined path for a few seconds, they stay in clusters
2b. Asteroids work like a floating ball that orbits the player while progressivly moving to their next move. they do damage on hit and when killed make 2 smaller asteroids.
2c. Boss Robots have three stages and act the same as normal robots, with each stage adding new cannons making more bullets and limiting dodging.
3. You get score for killing enemies 
3a Robots are 300 points
3b Asteroids are 300 but along killing the smaller ones you get 100 each, in total 500
3c Boss Robots are worth 750
4. Theres a time speedrun which  you set the wave you want to hit and try to get to it as fast as you can. The speedrun waves are not consistant and will alter the spawns of enemies each time. meaning you need a bit of luck to get low enemy rates.
5. There are different kinds of weapons and build types each with new powers and buffs
5a Different guns exist such as big bullet boomerang railgun and good ol bullet. Some are set in custimization, others are powerups (orbs that drop from enemies that are grabable)
5b Your ship can change its build and with it comes different buffs (and debuffs) like shield and slow movement.
6. Custimization is avalible in color wheel and 5 body shapes , along with 8 guns
